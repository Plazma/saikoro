**** SAIKORO! DICE ROLLER FOR HAPPY FUN TIME!! *****

This is just a dice roller I made for someone.

It allows you to customize the number of dice you want (up to 50) as well as how many
sides you want per die (up to 50). You can also tell it how many rolls you want per die.


**** COMPILING ****

This software should compile with the latest FreePascal compiler via (fpc saikoro.pas)


**** TO USE ****

This is a command-line only application with a menu system that's pretty self explanatory. 


> Mac/Linux: ./saikoro

> Windows:    sakoro.exe
